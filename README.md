**DESCRIPTION**

This S.T.A.L.K.E.R Anomaly mod brings elements souls style games to Stalker. Upon death your are rescued by a random Stalker in the zone. They bring you back to the set last spawn location where you awake to find a message from them about how you were found and the lengths they may have gone to to get you to a safe place. 

DISCLAIMER: Stop crying, this mod is suppose to make the game harder. Because of this it's 100% possible to get yourself into a situation where you unexpectedly lose your gear. Random item loss on death means you could lose your weapons or armor, dying in the middle of an anomaly and not being able to get your gear back is possible and expected.  Always stock a backup kit, plan for the worst, hope for the best.

**FEATURES**

- 100% Customizable experience through MCM
- 100% (as far as I know) conflict free from other mods.  Jabbers' Soulslike Mod does not overwrite any scripts or ltx files and because of this it should not interfere with any other mods. If it does please let me know so I can resolve.
- Upon death
 - Respawn locations can be set at any bed
 - Stash with some or all of the players items drops on the ground.
 - Item condition/loss scales based on rank in order to not hinder the players early game progress.
 - Item condition degrade each death (configurable).
 - Item loss % applied each death (configurable).
 - Lost items can be found on nearby enemy NPCs (configurable).
 - Players must heal upon respawn (configurable).
 - Time will pass to simulate recovery.
 - The player will be hungry and/or thirsty at respawn based on the time passed.
 - Your PDA will be updated to show where the relative position is of your corpse
 - Dynamic message from your rescuer will be sent to you to explain what happene and information about your gear
 - Player does an inventory check and lists everything missing upon retrieving your gear
- Hardcore save mode where you can only save by sleeping (sometimes requiring sleeping pills) and respawning.
 - Hardcore save mode only keeps around 1 save file.
 - Ability to use campfires to save (configurable)

In order to incorportate some rhyme and reason as to why you do not die, each time you respawn a stalker from your faction will message you about how they found you and rescued you, leaving you information about where you died and possibly leaving you some food and water if your sateity and thirst are low. d

**INSTALLATION**

Simply extract into your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly installation folder.

**FAQ**

**Q**: Doesn't this already exist with the Azazel game mode?  
**A**: Sorta, while Azazel does allows you to continue as a new stalker after dieing, You cannot play story mode at the same time, with Soulslike you can.

**Q**: I died in the middle of and I cannot get my gear back what do I do?  
**A**: First you can stop crying about it, that's the whole point of this mod... An actual consiquence for dying.  If you died in a shit location, well... that sucks, go get some new gear and continue playing or start over, choice is yours.

**Q**: I decided to play with Hardcore Saves and my save location is awful and I cannot continue.  
**A**: Yup, that can happen, awful, im so sad for you... see the DISCLAIMER above.  OK so I'm not a total fucking jackass.. if you have to you can restore a save from the "appdata\savedgames\soulslike-backup" folder, yes, I backed up some, if not all the saves that are deleted.

**Q**: I have an idea for progression that isnt included in this mod, how do I contact you.  
**A**: Well, the easiest way would be discord.  You can join my personal discord (https://discord.gg/HRyCGesuXq) and message me direct. I can also be found live most days on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/jabbers_) so feel free to stop by and say Hi! Additionally you can leave me a message on moddb... although this isnt my preferred communication platform so my response may be slower.

**TODO**
- Offset the radius of the PDA death location 
- Create an item that needs to be used to set a respawn point (optional with mcm)
